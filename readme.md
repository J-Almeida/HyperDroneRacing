# Hyper Drone Racing

Hyper Drone Racing is a prototype for a 3rd person 3D racer with flying drones. Players must fly through the air while crossing checkpoints represented by floating hexagonal arches.

This game was developed as the final project of a Game Development class; the visual design, 3D models and assets were created by colleagues from the Design course; audio effects were developed by colleagues from the Multimedia course.
